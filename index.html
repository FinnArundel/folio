            <p>A computer-generated asemic typeface. The work seeks to highlight the issues present in the misunderstood and enigmatic AI systems that are increasingly making decisions that affect billions of lives. The typeface is presented in an <a href="https://finnarundel.github.io/A2theK/Aisemic_Sampler/" target="_blank">online type sampler</a> which utilises a Markov chain algorithm to generate paragraphs based on significant economic, political and philosophical writings. The typeface is unreadable to humans, but words can be revealed through interaction with the web-page. Plaese message for the font file.</p>

            <h1>Artificial Nature</h1>
            <p>Artificial Nature is a video and sonic work, aestheticising scientific tools and knowledge. It is the result of an artist-in-residency program at <a href="https://www.testing-grounds.com.au/" target="_blank">Testing Grounds</a>, and is exhibiting as part of Public Art Park 2023. As part of PAP 2023, I also ran a workshop teaching a data-sonification technique I had developed during the residency.
            <br><br>
            The work utilises satellite imagery from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 mission. The method of band wavelength combinations is reinterpreted for aesthetic purposes, with a series of false colour images produced alongside scientific true-colour and infrared combinations.
            <br><br>
            The sonic component of the work is created through a data-sonification of an EOSDIS data-set, comprising global natural disaster events from the year 1970 to 2021. Through a series of software, the data is played through month by month, with a specific note assigned to each category of disaster, which is triggered if the event occurs in the selected month.
